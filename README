To build, run 'make'

To run without using openmp, command looks like this:
mpirun -np 4  --hostfile host_file ./mpi_matrix 1500 1500 1500 0 0
           ^ 4 processors
                         ^looks for this host file
												^M   ^N   ^P   ^don't print
														   no OMP^

Here is an example running 1 processor, no print, 1500 square, and using the openMP option. You should run on the cluster like this (but vary np):
mpirun -np 1 --bind-to none --hostfile host_file ./mpi_matrix 1500 1500 1500 0 1
